because such stock funds carry builtin dollar exposure investors with other home currencies that had not neutralized the foreign exchange risk were cushioned when the dollar was strong if wall street performed badly but the dollars correlation with other us assets and the impact of its fall on portfolio performance came into sharper focus when the trump administration announced farreaching global tariffs on april sending us stock indexes and the greenback sharply lower the dollar hit a threeyear low against a basket of currencies raising risks for investors whose portfolios once benefited from the natural hedge now managers are reducing dollar exposures and increasing the hedge ratios for us stock portfolios where clients investment policies allow them to do so about of russell investments pension fund clients in europe and the uk have already increased hedge ratios on their international stock portfolios said van luu global head of solutions strategy for fixed income and foreign exchange for russell in london one client raised it to from highlighting the desire to have a greater portion of us stocks protected against the weakening dollar if what were seeing persists then you will have more clients taking action in that direction said luu more hostile the dollar is down for the year and since us president donald trumps socalled liberation day in april meanwhile the sp the benchmark us stock index has recovered since an april slump and is up this year flirting with record highs the msci gauge of global stocks minus the us has risen for the year its not enough to look at

asset classes bnp has been reducing dollar exposures for its clients that include pension funds sovereign wealth funds and central banks it has sold us dollars across stock and fixed income portfolios and built up what vassallo described as a sizable position in options for funds that allow these strategies he said the euro yen and the australian dollar are among the primary currencies it bought against the dollar a big contrast to how the asset manager ended the previous year with a small overweight in the us dollar this switch towards a more uncertain policy regime created an environment where we as market participants see the us as more hostile to international capital flows international trading vassallo said after a june review justin onuekwusi chief investment officer at st jamess place said it is maintaining a strategic hedge that allows it to reduce overseas currency exposure in favor of the pound by up to the strategy has been beneficial for our clients returns year to date

Deol,"July 2, 2025",dubaibased kamdar developments is exploring opportunities in the gcc real estate market particularly saudi arabia as it continues to prioritise highend residential projects we closely monitor progress in saudi arabia particularly with the enormous potential of vision and the kingdoms gigaprojects founder and chairman yousuf kamdar told zawya projects he added that the private developer is open to forming joint ventures and partnerships with saudi companies construction is progressing as planned on the residences project in jumeirah village circle jvc with completion expected in the first quarter of kamdar said interview excerpts what market factors compelled you to launch residences in jumeirah village circle jvc as a business we have been investing in the uae for years we have seen the incredible rise of dubai particularly driven by visionary leadership and welcoming policies that attract businesses and investment demand to live and work in dubai has only risen in recent years with safety and quality of life driving an influx of new residents in line with our ambitions for the company we want to strategically acquire assets in locations that show good market fundamentals as a whole dubai ticks virtually every box looking at jvc specifically it is a good location with a growing community with attractive options for residents there is an increasing number of dining shopping entertainment leisure and lifestyle destinations emerging which is driving both investors and endusers to seek wellconstructed and wellmanaged properties who is the projects architect what is its usp in terms of design the projects design and architecture were done by arec the main usp of the project can be summarised as attainable luxury a place that has all the finish quality of a premium property at an affordable price point we have carefully considered what people require from wellness and fitness areas to relaxation zones and functional amenities what process did you follow to appoint luxedesign as the contractor when do you intend to deliverhand over the project luxedesign ldv is managing all stages of construction along with arec fundamentally we believe in delivering projects on time its an important part of building longterm trust residences is currently on track and targeting a first quarter of delivery and handover when did you acquire the land for the project are you now seeing an increase in land prices in jvc firstly there has been an uplift in the underlying value of the project we acquired ownership of the land in and have carefully planned its development what is the total cost of the project how do you intend to fund the project residences is fully funded by us we do not require thirdparty investment to complete the project what will be the sustainable elements of the project sustainability is a very important aspect of our projects ecofriendly materials that meet green building standards and energyefficient hvac systems tie in with nakheels master developer framework for jvc wherever possible we will also work with local suppliers knowing that transport and logistics incur a carbon cost the design and positioning of the building have also been considered to maximise natural light balanced with solar reflective materials that lower heat absorption in effect reducing interior lighting and cooling costs have you seen tender prices rise due to the uaes booming real estate sector tender prices have increased across the board specifically costs for suppliers and contractors for indemand elements such as mep and the provision of structural materials have risen we try to mitigate this by leveraging longterm relationships and utilising decades worth of market knowledge are you seeing an increase in construction costs in dubai are you concerned about it there has been an increase in construction costs as well as volatility in pricing due to regional and international supply chain disruptions there are various aspects to managing this including locking in fixed pricing for materials shifting elements of projects forward or backward dependent on requirements sensible budgeting and forecasting that includes contingency pricing cost tracking to quickly identify any potential areas of overspending before it becomes an issue and streamlined construction processes that minimise construction waste from our perspective our projects across jvc meydan jumeirah golf estates and dubai hills continue at full speed what are the biggest challenges you see in the coming years and how are you planning to overcome them the biggest concern at present is the escalation of hostilities in the region which could impact the supply chain theres also been some discussion of a market price correction but our take on this is quite simple is dubai a popular place to live and do we see that changing any time soon the answer is a resounding yes dubai is the most popular place to live in the entire middle east and no its popularity isnt going to diminish now or in the next hundred years so even if there are small cyclical dips the overall trajectory and potential for capital appreciation in dubai is upwards how extensive is your project portfolio in the uae we are currently developing our flagship residences and multiple villa developments in meydan jumeirah golf estates and dubai hills this includes a combination of public and private projects therefore we cannot disclose the overall development value of the portfolio in addition to the uae the business continues to operate across the middle east europe and africa managing our existing property portfolio and a pipeline of developments how much land bank do you own in the uae we have a substantial land bank in the uae we have longheld ambitions to diversify the portfolio to other emirates we are actively evaluating opportunities across abu dhabi sharjah and ras al khaimah as part of our expansion strategy are there plans to enter other markets in the middle east currently our focus remains on the uae however other gcc markets are also of interest to us given our focus on the luxury development segment we closely monitor progress in saudi arabia particularly with the enormous potential of vision and the kingdoms gigaprojects we remain open to joint ventures and partnerships with local saudi businesses seeking an agile developer what is your outlook on the real estate market in the uae particularly dubais offplan market for and for the most part we will see continued momentum driven by investment the population in the uae continues to grow driving demand for real estate overall pricing trends are difficult to neatly categorise into one box as the market is more nuanced however developments that are welllocated offer excellent amenities and have accessible price points will be popular we certainly see residences meeting these criteria reporting by p deol editing by anoop menon

nigerian governments on going dispute with cryptocur rency exchange binance has highlighted ongoing challenges over crypto regulation in africa individuals and even corporations have looked to digital currencies as a solution to shortages of hard currency but regula tors have failed to keep up with increasing transaction volumes and growing popu larity the industrys energy consumption also poses a challenge for the african power sector but it remains to be seen if the overall impact here will be positive or negative for the uninitiated cryptocurren cies are a form of digital currency but in contrast with central bank digital cur rencies they are not backed by a specific country or controlled by for the uninitiated cryptocurrencies area form of digital currency but in contrast with central bank digital currencies they are not backed by a specific country or controlled by a centralised financial institution they are stored in a digital wal let that users keep on a computer or smartphone and can be used to complete a wide range of transactions as long as the seller or provider is willing to accept them wallets can be either hot or cold hot wallets are connected to the internet to allow easy use while cold wallets are kept on usbs com puters or other physical devices for longerterm storage unlike with standard digital payments no third parties are in volved in enabling transactions which are made peertopeer and then permanently recorded on a blockchain database which is situated in various locations around the world cryptocurrencies are attractive to those who think decentralisation can bring fi nancial freedom blockchain is a digital database where transactions are cryptographically stored on linked sequential data groups also known as blocks unlike conventional databases that store information on one server in one loca tion this decentralised and distributed ledger stores identical copies of data across a global peertopeer network bitcoin which was launched in is the most famous cryptocurrency but there are thousands of alternatives in cluding litecoin and ripple blockchain based cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are acquired either through transactions or created through crypto mining which involves solving very complicated equa tions each crypto transaction is added to the blockchain by volunteers who them selves are rewarded with bitcoin these equations are becoming stead ily more complicated to rein in the amount of bitcoin in circulation the number of bitcoin that can be mined has been capped at m with most already in circulation when the bitcoin blockchain reaches a certain size roughly every four years the number of bitcoins given to miners who successfully validate transactions is cut in half as the value of bitcoin has risen trades have taken place in ever smaller fractions at present the smallest unit of currency is the satoshi which is millionth of a bitcoin the sector may get a boost from us president donald trumps strong sup port for crypto with bitcoin breaking the barrier for the first time after he successfully secured a second term of office trump has now pledged to turn the us into the crypto capital of the planet in sharp contrast with his description of bitcoin as a scam in trump has said that he would like to see bitcoin held as a reserve asset but this strategy has been ruled out in some other jurisdictions including by south africas central bank governor lesetja kganyago some governments have heavily regu lated taxed or restricted cryptocurrency including china where the peoples bank of china banned all crypto transactions in india imposed a tax on crypto income in while japan imposes taxes on a sliding scale of on profits from crypto trading crypto downsides one downside of crypto is that values tend to fluctuate very wildly stablecoins have been devised to reduce the level of volatility by linking their value to that of another asset such as a hard currency although there have also been spectacular price crashes here stablecoins linked to the dollar such as usdc and usdt have gained some popularity in subsaharan africa because of the lack of access to actual us dol lars and other hard currencies plus wide fluctuations in the values of some local currencies they have even become more popular for international remit tances among ethiopians work ing overseas who want to transfer money to family members at home according to blockchain analy sis firm chainanalysis stablecoins account for about of crypto transactions by volume in sub saharan africa to take one ex ample it recorded a increase in stablecoin transfers in ethiopia in the year to june probably as a result of currency restrictions which eased slightly in july after the government relaxed cur rency regulations as part of its ne gotiations with the imf another disadvantage is that crypto mining is very energy intensive and places a strain on power generation that could be used for other purposes however power plants in the us for example are now being specifically developed to supply data mining operations in january crypto mining firm phoenix group concluded a power purchase agree ment ppa with ethiopian electric power eep for mw to supply its operations the electricity will presumably be used by data centres in ethiopia although its location and the generation technology involved were not revealed headquartered in abu dhabi phoenix already has mining operations in the uae us and canada and said in a statement that it is looking at regions with strong energy prospects for more capacity there has been a string of mining in vestment in ethiopia over the past cou ple of years with reports in the region suggesting that the industry consumed mw of ethiopian capacity by the end of data centres need a power supply which ethiopias hydro indus try can supply ppas provide longterm guaranteed revenue for power companies allowing them to invest in other projects however crypto mining can also be a drain on the power sector kazakhstan became a centre for crypto mining in with massive investment in new data centres in the country yet this put the kazakh grid under huge strain prompting the government to impose restrictions and taxes on the sector in the operat ing system used by the second biggest cryptocurrency ethereum was changed to use far less energy but most competitor cryptocurrencies have yet to follow suit popularity in nigeria a great deal of focus has centred on nige rian cryptocurrency regulation because of the popularity of alternative finance in the country uptake has increased as nigerians have put savings into cryptocurrencies because of uncer tainty over the nigerian economy including relating to fluctuating naira exchange rates and oil prices as a result the country has become africas biggest digital asset mar ket by some distance and a crypto trading centre of global importance nigeria ranks second on chain analysis list of the countries with the highest adoption of crypto be hind india but ahead of indonesia and the us no other african coun try ranks in the top although ethiopia is ranked th kenya th and south africa th the conti nents transaction volume for the year to june stood at bn a rise of bn on the previous year but accounts for just of total global transaction volume accord ing to the same platform despite the sectors growing popularity the nigerian government has had a wellpublicised dispute with cryp tocurrency exchange binance claiming that it has failed to pay taxes and enabled tax evasion through its platform two of the companys executives were detained in in response to fears that naira trad ing on the binance exchange caused cur rency volatility prompting the company to halt trading in the naira the companys founder and former ceo changpeng zhao also spent four months in a us prison in for facilitating money laundering in february the nigerian government took legal action against the company as a whole for a claimed bn in unpaid taxes fines and interest covering and plus bn in damages although binance is not registered in nigeria the countrys federal inland revenue service argues that it is liable for corporation tax because it has a significant economic presence in the country part of the problem is that exchanges have often not been based in any specific jurisdiction where they can be regulated binance for instance has been registered in different countries at different times but is now not registered in any country and is currently assessing its options for a new global headquarters nigerias information minister moham med idris said that the government was committed to the growth of the digital assets sector and that its action against binance was not a reflection of its view on the industry as a whole he said the abuja was merely seeking to protect investors and regulated virtual asset service pro viders vasps another part of the problem has been regulatory uncertainty but new legisla tion could help settle the place of crypto in the nigerian economy nigerias new investment and securities bill was signed into law at the start of april by president bola tinubu providing a much needed replacement to the outdated legis lation acknowledging the new trading platforms it gives cryptocurrency assets official recognition as a digital repre sentation of value that can be transferred digitally traded and used for payment or investment purposes although this does not cover central bank digital currencies digital assets and investment contracts are now classified as securities under the regulation of the securities and exchange commission which will also oversee vasps the first vasp licences were is sued to nigerian exchanges busha and quidax last year with more expected to be awarded this year cryptocurrency has also grown in popularity at the expense of the enaira africas first digital currency which the government launched in although built on blockchain technology takeup of enaira has been disappointingly low and even of those who registered for ewallets failed to use them within the first year other african governments have al ready been forced to regulate trade in digi tal assets to counter money laundering including for terrorist organisations beyond such fears there is pressure on african regulators to provide clearer guidance on the use of crypto in order to encourage greater uptake meme coins insecurity has driven interest in crypto elsewhere on the continent in central african repub lic became just the second country in the world after el salvador to recognise bitcoin as legal tender then in february bangui issued a meme coin which are crypto tokens in a move president faustinarchange touadra said was designed to promote the coun try meme coins are cryptocur rencies named after trends or light jokes some coins have gained multibilliondollar market caps and garnered celebrity endorsements this came just weeks after trump launched his own meme coin the trump almost imme diately the market cap reached bn with trump companies holdings at bn the value of the trump peaked at but had crashed to by the time he unveiled his new global tariffs on april highlighting the extreme volatility of meme coin values writing on x cars president faustin archange touadra said it was an exper iment designed to show how something as simple as a meme can unite people support national development and put the central african republic on the world stage in a unique way it is too early to judge whether such strategies will be successful and the long term place of crypto currency in global finance remains uncertain yet regulators would be advised to put the necessary support and safeguards in place now for whatever

medical research and diagnostics,Staff Writer,"July 2, 2025",africas fastgrowing young population and enthusiastic adoption of digital technology could pave the way for the continent to fasttrack science innovation and become a world leader in diagnostics analysis and research this is according to industry bodies speakers and exhibitors of analytica lab africa south africas only trade fair for laboratory technology analysis biotechnology and diagnostics roman paeske cofounder and managing director at partnaer and dr aleksandra nijakpaeske phd consultant for medical genetics and bioinformatics at partnaer who will speak at the lab forum at analytica lab africa say africas diverse populations and potential developments in the regulatory environment offer opportunities for researchers in a number of fields paeske says africas young mobileenabled population has the potential to take the lead in developing mobilefirst solutions for healthcare and research it would be very interesting to develop mobile innovations in africa and position africa as a leader in this kind of technology he says in the medical field personalised medicine is also a huge trend so targeted medicine and diagnostics specific for the african population could be fasttracked here because this population has a different genetic variation than the rest of the world nijakpaeske says in europe and the us researchers are focusing largely on the caucasian population whereas diverse population groups in africa offer huge potential to generate broader databases for genetics even for stem cell research which would push forward personalised medicine for various populations she also sees potential for advanced labs to support medical tourism to africa africa has very experienced researchers working on tuberculosis or hiv this creates opportunities to develop centres for research and treating international patients with hiv or tuberculosis she says another area with growth potential is in vitro fertilisation ivf regulations in europe can be challenging whereas africa has an opportunity to create an enabling regulatory environment that could support the development of a flourishing international ivf industry and international stem cell research paeske adds that africa could advance laboratories and overcome many of their challenges by digitising processes harnessing ai and making critical resources available locally africa depends on a lot of imported resources but the more africa is able to do it themselves in terms of supplies such as reagents or lab equipment the more selfsustainable the sector will become growing manufacturing and the whole supply chain could create jobs build skills and grow the industry i believe the african laboratory sector has huge potential to become a key player from a global perspective benjamin barkley md of bennyza notes that there are opportunities for suppliers to laboratories to offer more value to support lab progress he says scientific institutions laboratories and researchers are not typical consumers and they shouldnt receive typical service in a field where precision reliability and adaptability are critical parameters offtheshelf solutions rarely meet the nuanced needs of research environments thats why distributors must offer more than just products they must deliver added value through expert guidance tailored support and a deep understanding of the scientific landscape in which they operate by combining cuttingedge equipment with specialist knowledge and personalised service distributors can help unlock the full potential of the technology alet de lange country manager at esco technologies south africa believes africa stands at the threshold of a scientific revolution with laboratories set to play a critical role in advancing healthcare biotechnology and pharmaceutical innovation she says emerging technologies like mrna are not only transforming global medicine but also opening new possibilities for localised vaccine production personalised therapies such as tailored cancer treatments and disease prevention initiatives for conditions like hiv malaria and influenza across the continent de lange notes for africa to fully harness this potential investment in stateoftheart laboratories equipped with advanced technologies such as isolators cleanrooms and biomanufacturing facilities as well as a strong focus on skilled workforce development will be essential opportunities abound in building local capacity for research and production reducing reliance on imports and improving longterm health outcomes while challenges such as infrastructure sustainable funding and regulatory alignment remain the outlook is promising africas laboratories are wellpositioned to become vibrant centers of innovation that will shape the next generation of healthcare solutions both regionally and globally while there are numerous opportunities for the sector many challenges need to be overcome lomo senoamadi managing director of bashumi instruments and control services bics says a key challenge facing laboratory services in africa is the lack of investment in local capabilities including infrastructure technical expertise and consistent servicing support many laboratories still rely heavily on imported equipment consumables and chemicals when equipment breaks down or there is a surge in demand the turnaround time for repairs or replenishments can be lengthy and expensive she says senoamadi adds there is also a significant gap in training we need to develop more local technicians who are confident in maintaining and calibrating laboratory equipment this requires investing in mentorship practical learning and upskilling individuals already working in the field collaboration is essential for progress she says often individuals and organisations work in isolation which limits potential advancements by fostering collaboration across various industries and sectors we can enhance our collective efforts sharing knowledge creating inclusive opportunities and supporting one another can significantly strengthen the entire ecosystem working together not only drives innovation but also leads to more sustainable outcomes sonja oosthuizen regional sales leader at perkinelmer south africa highlights numerous other challenges some of the key issues our customers face today include limited resources quality control issues and workforce shortages many laboratories struggle with inadequate funding which affects their ability to maintain stateoftheart equipment hire skilled personnel and conduct comprehensive research ensuring consistent standards is essential for reliable results but it can be challenging due to varying conditions and the need for rigorous quality management systems there is also a global shortage of skilled professionals such as laboratory technicians scientists and researchers oosthuizen adds that some of these issues could be reduced by minimising bottlenecks and increasing throughput efficient workflow optimisation involves careful planning resource allocation and technology integration to ensure seamless operations she says steve sidney executive director of the national laboratory association south africa nlasa says without a doubt escalating technological advances and digital transformation have brought with them exciting opportunities for the optimisation of processes and throughput together with an increase in quality control and compliance in the future improved instrument interconnectedness due to the internet of things iot will permit more efficient data collection while automation and robotics for handling equipment samples and chemicals will impact on productivity and reproducibility and reduce handling errors sidney says equally analytics such as artificial intelligence ai and machine learning will enable the collating and analysing of data from labs across the globe visualisation tools such as augmented reality will not only enhance what can be seen with digital information but also enable the realtime capturing of quality control data he says however he notes that unlocking the potential of these novel technologies comes with increased risks of cyber breaches and cyberattacks making cyber security of paramount importance to the digital lab in addition the lab of the future will be under greater pressure in terms of sustainability energyefficiency and environmental responsibility and to design more open coworking areas for better collaboration and teamwork sidney says with todays innovative technologies and tomorrows emerging and as yet unheard of technologies it can be safely said that the lab of the future will be an exciting one an example of transformative digital technology for the sector is new aidriven data management and laboratory information management systems lims analytica lab africa silver sponsor lasec will demonstrate a new lims solution at

like hedging instruments risk guarantees liquidity buffers or blended capital are not consistently used often they are misaligned with market realities too costly too late or designed for risk profiles that dont match local conditions the result is exclusion with projects stalling not for lack of merit but for lack of structural readiness to carry risk from origination to execution additionally when the probability of adverse events that impair investment value is perceived to be high investors respond in predictable ways either by walking away from the opportunity or by demanding higher returns to compensate for the anticipated volatility both responses create a widening gap between capital availability and project viability this becomes particularly consequential when measured against the continents developmental objectives the african union has set a target of gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by more than four times the gigawatts installed as of end according to bloombergnef the international energy agency estimates that achieving this scale will require annual energy investment across the continent to rise from usd billion today to over usd billion by with clean power generation and enabling infrastructure absorbing the bulk of that increase the cost of capital becomes a defining variable here most african governments face fiscal constraints that limit their ability to directly fund clean energy infrastructure with high debt servicing costs further narrowing fiscal space this has entrenched a reliance on external capital from dfis which may offer lower or concessional rates and from local and international financiers who must price in elevated risk even in markets with clear policy signals and successful project track records the cost of capital remains materially higher than global benchmarks overcoming these barriers will require innovative financing solutions and more importantly risk mitigation that is embedded from the outset in an ideal context regionally integrated policy interventions would create durable investoraligned regulatory environments reducing the likelihood of project disruptions linked to permitting delays or sudden legislative shifts yet such reforms are complex resourceintensive and slow to take hold by contrast financial risk mitigation instruments can be deployed more rapidly offering immediate support to project structuring while longerterm reforms take shape hedging is one of the most critical instruments in this regard it functions as a shock absorber protecting returns in the event of unanticipated rate hikes currency depreciation or inflationary pressure it reduces exposure to financial volatility helping improve bankability by lowering perceived risk and by stabilising cash flows it supports investor confidence in the longterm viability of a project however traditional financial hedging tools are not always viable or costeffective for managing financial risk in african energy markets particularly in relation to foreign exchange volatility currency convertibility constraints thin derivatives markets and limited availability of longtenor instruments make it difficult to secure protection against depreciation or payment delays local currency financing while structurally desirable remains limited in scale expensive in cost and often unavailable at the tenors required for infrastructure these dynamics expose both developers and lenders to significant valuation and repayment risk especially in jurisdictions where power purchase agreements are denominated in local currency but backed by dollar or eurobased financing beyond mitigating translation risk hedging has increasingly played a pivotal role in supporting currency convertibility particularly in markets with intermittent foreign exchange liquidity in some jurisdictions these instruments are facilitated directly by central banks or structured through commercial banks with central bank backing offering a critical layer of protection where capital markets cannot where even these tools are unavailable developers often turn to tailored contractual structures aligning pricing payment terms and currency exposure to create natural hedges that offer stability through design rather than financial engineering as renewable investment scales across the continent conventional risk tools will need to be complemented by marketresponsive strategies that reflect the institutional and financial realities of each context these questions are likely to shape the agenda at the africa energy forum where under the theme africa united stakeholders will be called to develop coherent approaches to risk that align ambition with executable design investors often point to a shortage of bankable projects on the continent signalling the need for more equity at early stages where risk is highest and structure is most consequential earlystage support whether in the form of catalytic equity concessional finance or targeted risksharing mechanisms deployed with greater risk appetite and paired with relevant policy reform can help anchor project design and absorb volatility but to build a truly investable environment these inputs must be matched by innovative financing and risk management strategies designed for the realities of african markets to support this financial institutions with deep market presence and structuring expertise play a pivotal role in translating ambition into bankable execution for example in south africa absa provides clients with access to a full spectrum of risk management instruments from longtenor interest rate and inflationlinked swaps to foreign exchange forwards and options enabling more predictable financial outcomes across multiyear horizons across the continent absas multiasset structuring teams work with sovereign financial and corporate clients to design tailored hedging secured financing and balance sheet solutions that respond to local market conditions while meeting institutional investment standards when markets offer credible instruments capable institutions and solutions aligned to realworld risk investment decisions become less speculative and more strategic the driver in this case sets out not because the road is guaranteed to be smooth but because the destination holds promise and the vehicle has been set up to endure the journey copyright africabusinesscom all materials can be used freely indicating the origin africabusinesscom provided by syndigate media inc

and the right economics",Staff Writer,"July 2, 2025",in todays rapidly evolving digital age customers are increasingly dynamic their demands shifting and driving exponential change in how products and services are used our challenge as financial service institutions both traditional and new age is effectively grappling with the need to consistently update and refresh digital platforms products and services while maintaining gold standard digital customer experiences all at the right economics the benchmark for user expectations isnt limited to peers in banking or fintech it extends to leading global digital platforms like meta crypto providers and other intuitive highperforming technologies such as streamers music and video constant disruption has become the hallmark of digital transformation in banking widening not only access and inclusion but also reach and according to the latest african digital banking transformation report the potential for growth in digital banking services in africa only stands to grow even further the african technology landscape is continually evolving and the ongoing digital revolution that incorporates the majority of the continents billion people their specific needs is fully underway consumers are increasingly digitally savvy and mobileled across the continent with million registered mobile money accounts operating in africa according to data from the global system for mobile communications association gsma absas own digital adoption rates among customers reflect that with digital activity rates reaching in some of our leading markets todays african consumers demand speed convenience and userfriendly digital experiences whether theyre interacting with their bank an insurance platform or a tech company this has raised the bar significantly for financial institutions striving to deliver goldstandard digital interactions while managing costs and operational efficiency the dual imperative experience and economics one of the central challenges for banks and financial service providers is balancing exceptional digital customer experiences with sustainable economics delivering a toptier digital experience requires significant investment in technology but it also demands a focus on costefficiency to ensure profitability many institutions including absa are undertaking a comprehensive digital channel overhaul a complete groundup rebuild designed to incorporate cuttingedge digital capabilities and improved economics by accelerating timetomarket digital products as the african digital landscape continues to evolve maintaining relevance isnt just about competing with other banks its about standing shoulder to shoulder with the best digital businesses globally to achieve this financial services providers must embrace innovation at the intersection of experience and efficiency this need to innovate is embodied in the rise of neobanks where a continuous digital focus has seen challenger banks continue to seize popularity among consumers the recent brand finance journal study the banking showed that digitalfirst institutions were consistently moving up the ranks while african banking brands saw growth in the past year none made the top but those focusing on digital solutions and inclusive finance were punching well above their weight on the banking index super apps the future of customercentric ecosystems but what is the nexus between digital innovation and inclusive finance platforms that are both accessible and offer entirely different takes on existing services or are providing new offerings entirely in recent years weve witnessed ongoing discourse around the super app apps that integrate all banking and service functions like insurance investments and digital storefronts onto a single platform which many claim are revolutionising the banking sector they provide the versatility customers need but when developed correctly offer highly personalised experiences that are tailored to a specific user unlike traditional banking apps which focus solely on financial transactions super apps cater to broader lifestyle needs they enable users to access services such as booking flights purchasing groceries or arranging entertainment all within a single interface however if they are not userfriendly or are prone to service disruptions they can completely destroy trust with their associated brand which is why investing in such platforms must be done with the utmost care and the right developer partners but when these apps are done right such as the safaricoms mpesa digital payment platform which allows other businesses to embed their own apps inside it they can utterly dominate in a given market developing new digital ecosystems in financial services absas own work with safaricom originated from our goal of delivering exceptional customer experiences in kenya weve pioneered embedded finance solutions to enable customers to seamlessly access absa financial products such as credit directly through their safaricom interface by integrating our offerings into an ecosystem that customers already trust and use daily we create a frictionless user experience embodying the principles of embedded finance in mauritius we have also established a robust open banking framework that facilitates integration with thirdparty platforms this digital marketplace empowers external platforms to offer their products to our customers while simultaneously enabling us to expose financial services to broader audiences the result is a dynamic ecosystem a digital marketplace tailored to the needs of modern consumers blending both financial and nonfinancial services beyond ourselves we recognise that for all financial services providers enhancing traditional channels such as mobile apps web platforms and ussd services will remain essential but the next frontier lies in meeting customers where they are todays challenge is persuading users entrenched in familiar ecosystems such as social media to engage with new digital platforms asking customers to navigate governance security and compliance hurdles within traditional ecosystems often results in friction and dropoffs for the million unbanked adults in subsaharan africa those craving inclusion in economies and trading ecosystems it is essential that we reduce these barriers if we continue to use digital innovation to make account creation payments and investments easier we can reduce poverty empower our entrepreneurs and close the economic gaps across the continent

businesses to switch to clean renewable energy in their production process internal competition between the manufacturers of solar panels in china is good news for local businesses as this keeps driving down the cost of the panels it makes going solar an entirely affordable option but we recommend making this move only after careful consideration and planning says cruise energy independence cruise says the decision to move offgrid through solar pv is a strategic one driven by several key factors cost certainty and savings while the initial investment in a solar pv system is a significant consideration it offers longterm cost predictability and substantial savings unlike volatile eskom tariffs solar energy provides a hedge against future price hikes the upfront costs are increasingly offset by rapidly decreasing solar panel prices and various financing options including power purchase agreements green energy loans and attractive tax incentives going the financing route enables businesses to receive immediate netmonthly savings with solar and lock in stable electricity price increases without spending any money energy security and resilience a welldesigned solar pv system particularly a hybrid or offgrid solution with battery storage provides a reliable and continuous power supply mitigating the impact of outages load reduction and ensuring business continuity environmental responsibility and brand reputation adopting solar demonstrates a commitment to sustainability and reduces a companys carbon footprint this not only aligns with global environmental goals but also enhances brand reputation increased property value and tax benefits investing in solar energy systems can significantly increase property value the south african revenue service sars offers the b solar tax incentive for businesses investing in renewable energy which enables a rebate from sars of the total cost of their solar system large carbon dioxide emitters also benefit by reducing their carbon tax which will become increasingly more expensive from onwards as phase two of the carbon tax act comes into effect what to consider cruise advises businesses considering the transition to solar to assess the following energy consumption profile a detailed analysis of current electricity usage patterns is crucial to determine the optimal size and type of solar pv system system type financial investment and roi businesses must evaluate the initial capital outlay against the projected energy savings and potential return on investment roi which can be recovered over a relatively short period given the long lifespan of solar panels tax incentives sars offered several incentives to encourage solar installation but the structure has changed and there is a real chance that they will fall away from april this puts a time pressure on installations to happen this year still before incentives fall away potentially financing options explore various financing models including outright purchase power purchase agreements for zero upfront cost leasetoown options and green energy loans from financial institutions professional assessment and installation engaging reputable solar providers ensures accurate system design highquality equipment and professional installation maximising efficiency and longevity gridtied systems connected to the eskom grid these systems reduce reliance on eskom and can feed excess power back into the grid potentially earning credits they are generally the most costeffective entry point hybrid systems combining solar panels with battery storage these offer greater energy independence and backup during outages while still leveraging grid connection offgrid systems these systems provide complete energy independence eliminating reliance on eskom they typically involve solar panels significant battery storage and often a generator as a backup the conversations around eskom tariffs are louder than ever and businesses are actively seeking solutions that offer stability and longterm economic sense adds cruise the next nine months will be a very interesting period for solar installations in south africa as companies move to make use of available tax incentives before they potentially fall away all rights reserved bizcommunitycom provided by syndigate media inc syndigateinfo
https://www.zawya.com/en/news/sponsored-content/the-fed-is-in-a-good-place-but-for-how-long-vg7t1zgr,The Fed is in a â€˜good placeâ€™ â€“ but for how long?,N/A,"May 15, 2025",fed officials remain patient likely awaiting hard evidence of a weaker us labor market before considering rate cuts the federal reserve left interest rates on hold as widely expected the main takeaway from the statement and press conference was uncertainty fed chair jerome powell repeatedly emphasized the unclear economic outlook as the central banks ratesetting committee met for the first time since the april tariff announcements the fed statement directly acknowledged that these trade policy changes have increased risks to both sides of its dual mandate tariffs are likely to weaken growth and spill over to the labor market even as they raise prices if these trends become clearer in data releases in the coming months which we expect though the latest inflation and employment reports were benign the fed will likely be in a challenging spot we believe the fed will hold off on rate cuts until hard evidence of a slowdown appears in labor market reports potentially not until late summer or fall once that evidence arrives however we expect the fed will cut rates quickly to support the economy in a good place in may as powell indicated at the press conference the fed seems to be in a good place and can be patient the april us employment report suggests the labor market is doing well and inflation is still somewhat above target so the fed has some luxury to wait for more information before making any decisions that take monetary policy out of restrictive territory powell also stated that given elevated inflation the fed wouldnt cut rates preemptively in an effort to get ahead of higher recession risks markets seemed undisturbed following the relatively quiet may fed meeting with us treasury yields ending the day near their preannouncement levels but a complicated and challenging outlook while there were few signs of disruption in the most recent inflation and employment data powell emphasized the uncertain and challenging outlook for fed officials initial conditions of a relatively solid economy and abovetarget inflation plus the economic implications of tariffs put the central bank in a tricky spot with tariffs the nearterm impacts tend to be higher inflation but lower real economic activity including employment indeed the fed revised its may statement relative to the prior release in march to acknowledge that risks of this conflicting outcome have increased thus the central bank must balance the risks and potential benefits of policy decisions lowering rates to support growth and employment risking higher inflation or keeping rates elevated to help restrain inflation and anchor inflation expectations risking higher unemployment waiting for clarity appears to be the central banks best strategy for now as powell made clear at this meeting in order to cut rates we think the fed will need to be confident that inflation expectations are wellanchored and recession risks are rising conclusively this assurance may not come until the data show definitive evidence that the labor market is decelerating or contracting in response to questions about cutting rates amid rising recession risks powell acknowledged that its not a situation where we can be preemptive tariffs should be expected to produce only a fleeting burst of inflation euphemistically called a price level adjustment but fed officials are acutely aware of the risks that come with both the scale and timing of this episode as companies pass some of the tariff costs on to consumers core us inflation could well breach with memories of the pandemics inflationary surge still fresh the danger is that increased inflation expectations could stoke nominal wage growth that would make it harder for the fed to bring inflation back to target without a firmer hand on policy worryingly inflation expectations are rising again surveys show that households businesses and forecasters are all bracing for higher inflation with oneyearahead expectations now back at pandemicera highs well before any broadbased evidence of firms raising prices longerterm measures such as the university of michigans fiveyear fiveyearahead gauge have climbed to levels unseen in a quartercentury we believe this means that fed officials are likely to proceed with caution waiting for clear evidence that inflation expectations remain anchored and labor markets are softening before making their next move tariffs and monetary policy lessons from history a world bank study of advanced economies from to finds that on average central banks raised policy rates by basis points bps for every percentage point increase in effective tariff rates the response however was not symmetric across economic environments in periods when inflation was running hot specifically when the threeyear average exceeded central banks were far more hawkish lifting shortterm rates by as much as bps for each percentage point increase in tariffs in cooler lowinflation environments policy rates barely budged notably in neither scenario was cutting rates the prevailing response currently the data indicate the us is likely in the former hotter camp as of march the threeyear average for headline inflation stands at history suggests this would tend to keep the fed holding steady both markets and policymakers see little chance of rate hikes bottom line given the next fed rate cut will likely require evidence of a weakening labor market exactly when it might start to contract is crucial trade policy shifting immigration rules federal government layoffs and a general air of uncertainty are all expected to weigh on the labor market at different points this year for now we believe the risk is that any real deterioration will not show up until summer which means given lags in the data that hard evidence of a labor market slowdown may not be in hand until the feds late july or more likely midseptember meeting even if trade tensions deescalate and tariffs moderate the us will still face import duties higher than anything seen in recent history the nearterm consequences are clear higher inflation lower real incomes and contracting investment the longerterm effects are less clear but they could include greater investment in us industries time will tell for now these economic challenges put the fed in a tough spot the evidence needed to prompt a rate cut likely wont appear until later this summer or early fall once it does we expect the fed to cut rates fairly quickly to view more insights from pimco click here

https://www.zawya.com/en/economy/africa/africa-blockchain-report-2025-blockchains-multifaceted-role-in-economic-development-o7gxy8we,Africa blockchain report 2025: Blockchainâ€™s multifaceted role in economic development,Staff Writer,"July 2, 2025",the newest blockchain activity across africa is highlighting the dynamism of this technology with use cases emerging that demonstrate exciting new developmental opportunities beyond its crypto transaction roots as south africa prepares to host the first g summit in africa a key theme set to be discussed throughout both the b business and g task teams is inclusive digital development weve already seen announcements from the g task force on artificial intelligence data governance and innovation for sustainable development stating their priorities with data governance quality privacy and security top of mind to ensure new technologies are harnessed for improved economies and better lives so in a year where blockchainfocused venture capital vc in africa outpaced allsector venture capital as revealed in absas recently released th edition of the african blockchain report the technology must remain a central part of such conversations blockchain specific investment activity has shown resilience and the data indicates investor appetite in digital infrastructure solutions is growing international and local investors are noticing the african entrepreneurial spirit investing in markets where talent and skills in tech sectors are growing this means even greater opportunities to leverage the technology and the institutions that embed it in their systems to help build stronger more sustainable african economies ai and blockchain revolutionising digital economies in recent months weve seen a fusion of both ai and blockchain technologies a development that has attracted both proponents and detractors however ai has been proven to enhance blockchains capabilities by providing predictive analytics automating processes and improving decisionmaking in financial services the rich data that exists on businesses and individuals from traditional sources bank accounts and books can be combined with new sources digital wallets mobile money to create new models for assessing risk and therefore build access to finance and credit especially for those who have been underbanked or unbanked previously this is an essential way of enabling digital and financial inclusion as more people and business can access credit but is also beneficial for banks who can monitor and predict defaults using ai tools and step in to help before its too late it certainly isnt farfetched to see a future world where digital money lives on blockchains with ai tooling monitoring real time activity and patterns to detect and prevent fraud money laundering and terrorist financing and money transfers happening seamlessly when preagreed conditions are met banks are already using both these super technologies but combining them will increase security and trust across all financial processes its surely just a matter of time before we see it happening at scale meanwhile the report has shown unique purposeled blockchain companies are attracting funding to develop important financial services crypto payments across various nations remittance and creditbuilding for africans and the diaspora trade access for smes small and medium enterprises and even the tokenisation of assets to make them more accessible investment products enabling supply chains and intraafrican trade its well understood that blockchain provides an immutable ledger that records every transaction and movement fostering transparency and reducing inefficiencies therefore harnessing this transparency in the complex process of international trade and supply chains is a huge opportunity in the realm of crossborder payments and trade the african continental free trade agreement afcfta aims to integrate a market valued at over trillion yet intraafrican trade currently represents less than a quarter of total trade volumes on the continent by leveraging stablecoins and tokenized trade finance financial institutions can reduce transaction costs improve liquidity for small and mediumsized enterprises and bolster regional economic integration outside financial services blockchain technology is already unlocking supply chains hyundai and dp world are just two examples of organisations using blockchain monitoring carbon emissions through the supply chain and tracking and tracing cargo all over the world within organisations blockchain can replace paperbased processes with digital procedures but if ecosystems can work together to create trust across full endtoend value chains the efficiency unlock could be profound through leveraging the trust and immutability of blockchain networks combined with auto executing smart contracts once a partys obligations are complete automation and removing friction in supply chains are obvious opportunities to pursue blockchain transforming financial market infrastructure it isnt just products and services that will be enhanced with blockchain technology new financial market infrastructures will evolve and have already blockchains decentralised nature and immutable records enhance the security and efficiency of financial transactions with enhanced trust and shared data through cryptographically signing and programmable smart contracts this means intermediaries which currently provide services across the financial ecosystem may no longer be necessary which could help reduce costs and speed up services the relative affordability of setting up and scaling blockchains can accelerate this shift and move away from the traditional technology stacks run for existing financial market infrastructure too through accessing regulatory nodes there is also the opportunity for regulators to be able to directly monitor transactions in real time instead of relying on banks and other market participants to send reports and data which are then ingested and reviewed meaning greater power to identify and prevent transactions that could be fraudulent or illicit in real time whether youre a believer of decentralisation or a believer that blockchain technology can offer new centralised infrastructure theres no doubt that increased peer to peer transactions are already happening and will continue to proliferate on blockchain technology especially without intermediary oversight bodies securing sustainable food systems and agriculture a once greatly underpromoted use of the technology namely in the agricultural sector is also finally gaining traction traceability for farmtofork consumers are increasingly wanting to understand what they eat and leveraging blockchain to ensure transparency and traceability in food production and distribution enables this easily blockchain lets farmers record and share data about their produce from planting to harvesting ensuring authenticity and quality but its not just about traceability either blockchain and ai solutions can help improve crop yields and provide data for a range of services from veterinary and insurance to applying for credit facilities the opportunities and use cases are wide and varied which is why we believe its an area that sure to grow in the years to come and especially for small holding farming across africa in the coming months as g and b recommendations are implemented and new regulatory frameworks emerge to keep pace with recent advancements we will likely see even more novel uses of blockchain technology however it is essential that financial institutions like our own continue to actively promote and enable the most sustainable and purposedriven uses of the technology copyright

https://www.zawya.com/en/business/technology-and-telecom/from-tractor-tweets-to-crop-status-updates-how-ai-is-cultivating-the-future-of-farming-pqvecjaq,From tractor tweets to crop status updates: How AI is cultivating the future of farming?,Arno Hanekom,"July 2, 2025",ai in agriculture is rapidly shifting from being a distant concept to a practical transformative tool but amid all the hype the real story that has emerged doesnt focus on the technology itself but on the people using it source supplied like any other entrepreneur farmers operate on instinct gut feel knowledge understanding and experience innately knowing when to plant when to irrigate and how to respond to seasonal shifts and this is something that cannot be replaced with ai what ai does offer though is a way to back up those instincts with data so the farmers judgment isnt being replaced with algorithms but rather ai is there to support and validate it we call this intuitive ai not prescriptive ai agricultural tools powered by ai are now capable of analysing everything from historical crop data to satellite imagery and weather trends but as impressive as these technologies are they do not offer onesizefitsall solutions local farmers in particular are sceptical by nature and rightly so its very rare to find a single ai solution that would be fit for all purposes thats why trust and relevance are key to adoption every farm is different and so is every farmers relationship with technology thus datacentrixs message is simple farming data should be like farming land think of ai as being similar to a mobile phone it has a thousand features but we probably use only five of them daily the same logic can be applied to ai platforms boxed generic ai solutions wont be able to tick every box and instead the approach of aiming small to miss small should be taken this places focus on smaller projects and proof of concepts where a use case is taken and solved specifically based on required outcomes or benefits data lives in many places on servers in the cloud and even in personal storage platforms like google drive or onedrive for farmers data is available on livestock feed weight and growth silos crops water utilisation pesticides fertilisers satellite and more theres also information available on the use of tractors or combines for example use hours and fuel consumption as well as on electricity usage all these various datasets can be consolidated in an aienabled cloud a central unified data architecture that acts as the repository or the brain for farming practices from there a discovery tool is used to mine and extrapolate answers to certain questions from the data this type of exploratory data analysis is based on pattern detection and trend analysis allowing users to listen to their data and uncover real beneficial use cases this approach can be used for any farming practice be it for the farm worker service schedules manufacturing production or any type of discipline its a case of taking the data unscrambling and adding logic to it through machine learning and ultimately helping the farmer to do more than predict yields by understanding the past and optimising the future for example a recent project embarked on by datacentrix involves the mining of many years of estuary data for fruit varietals looking at the pesticides and fertilisers used and mapping the information back to what should be paid per hectare varietal and colour of grape a common misconception is that ai is expensive complex and requires a large upfront investment to counter this datacentrix has developed aiasaservice a cloudbased offering designed to reduce risk and make adoption easy and accessible clients consume ai solutions on a subscription basis enabling them to start small and thereafter scale based on real value delivered without the need for a hefty upfront investment this model works across industries including finance retail manufacturing and of course agriculture whether its yield prediction soil health analysis or pest and fertiliser mapping solutions are tailored to the clients specific data and needs and provide realworld insight ai also shouldnt be difficult to use it should be simple to deploy low touch and low cost with minimal impact on workflow or a workforces daytoday operations while still having a high impact on business we believe the best solutions come from standing alongside our clients literally at datacentrix we call it walking the line we visit farms walk the fields talk through operations and then cocreate use cases with our customers based on what we have learned its a farmerfirst usecasefirst approach that ensures the technology is never disconnected from the context that it serves the use of ai in
